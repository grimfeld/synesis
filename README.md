# Bible Study Vault

A local-first, Obsidian-compatible note-taking app for Bible study. Notes, Clippings, Sources, and Compositions link to each other and to every Verse, Chapter, and Book they mention. Scripture references are detected as you type. Your vault is a plain folder of markdown files that you own and that opens in Obsidian.

```

`examples/sample-vault` is a small vault to open on first launch: two Notes, a Clipping, a Composition with an embedded Clipping, a nested Source, a Character, two Places with coordinates and a Concept. Opening it materialises the Scripture pages it mentions.
